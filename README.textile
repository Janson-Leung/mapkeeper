h2. Introduction

MapKeeper is a Thrift-based key-value store that supports various storage engines. Currently MapKeeper supports the following storage engines:

* "MySQL":http://www.mysql.com/
* "MySQL with HandlerSocket":http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2010/10/using-mysql-as-nosql-story-for.html
* "Berkeley DB":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/overview/index-085366.html
* "Berkeley DB Java Edition":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/overview/index-093405.html
* "LevelDB":http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/

You can run "YCSB":https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki against MapKeeper to benchmark different storage engines. See "this page":https://github.com/m1ch1/mapkeeper/tree/master/ycsb for more details on how to run YCSB against MapKeeper.

h2. Build Info

In order to configure the build, edit Makefile.config to point to the location of your copy of thrift.  If you ran thrift's "make install", the default (/usr/local) will likely work for you.  Otherwise, point
it at the top directory of the tarball after doing a "./configure ; make" in the thrift directory. Note that mapkeeper requires the Thrift C++ and Java bindings.
